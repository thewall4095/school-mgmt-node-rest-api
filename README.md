> Express REST API with JWT Authentication and support for sqlite, mysql, and postgresql

- authentication via [JWT](https://jwt.io/)
- routes mapping via [express-routes-mapper]
- support for [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/), [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/), and [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- environments for `development`, `testing`, and `production`
- linting via [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)
- integration tests running with [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)
- built with [npm sripts](#npm-scripts)

## Install and Use

Start by cloning this repository

```sh
# HTTPS
$ git clone https://github.com/thewall4095/school-mgmt-node-rest-api.git
```

then

```sh
# cd into project root
$ yarn
# to use mysql
$ yarn add mysql2
# to use postgresql
$ yarn add pg pg-hstore
# start the api
$ yarn start
```

or

```sh
# cd into project root
$ npm i
# to use mysql
$ npm i mysql2 -S
# to use postgresql
$ npm i -S pg pg-hstore
# start the api
$ npm start
```

sqlite is supported out of the box as it is the default.

## Folder Structure

This boilerplate has 4 main directories:

- api - for controllers, models, services, etc.
- config - for routes, database, etc.
- db - this is only a dir for the sqlite db, the default for NODE_ENV development
- test - using [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)

## Controllers

### Create a Controller

Controllers in this boilerplate have a naming convention: `ModelnameController.js` and uses an object factory pattern.
To use a model inside of your controller you have to require it.
We use [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) as ORM, if you want further information read the [Docs](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/).



## Models

### Create a Model

Models in this boilerplate have a naming convention: `Model.js` and uses [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) to define our Models, if you want further information read the [Docs](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/).


## Policies

Policies are middleware functions that can run before hitting a apecific or more specified route(s).

## Services

Services are little useful snippets, or calls to another API that are not the main focus of your API.


## Config

Holds all the server configurations.

## Connection and Database

> Note: if you use msql make sure mysql server is running on the machine

> Note: if you use postgres make sure postgres server is running on the machine

This two files are the way to establish a connaction to a database.

You only need to touch connection.js, default for `development` is sqlite, but it is easy as typing `mysql` or `postgres` to switch to another db.

> Note: to run a mysql db install these package with: `yarn add mysql2` or `npm i mysql2 -S`

> Note: to run a postgres db run these package with: `yarn add pg pg-hstore` or `npm i -S pg pg-hstore`

Now simple configure the keys with your credentials.

```js
{
  database: 'databasename',
  username: 'username',
  password: 'password',
  host: 'localhost',
  dialect: 'sqlite' || 'mysql' || 'postgres',
}
```

To not configure the production code.

To start the DB, add the credentials for production. add `environment variables` by typing e.g. `export DB_USER=yourusername` before starting the api.

## Routes

Here you define all your routes for your api. It doesn't matter how you structure them. By default they are mapped on `privateRoutes` and `publicRoutes`. You can define as much routes files as you want e.g. for every model or for specific use cases, e.g. normal user and admins.


## npm scripts

There are no automation tool or task runner like [grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) or [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) used for this boilerplate. These boilerplate only uses npm scripts for automatization.

### npm start

This is the entry for a developer. This command:

By default it uses a sqlite databse, if you want to migrate the sqlite db by each start, disable the `prestart` and `poststart` command. Also mind if you are using a sqlite database to delete the `drop-sqlite-db` in the prepush hook.

- runs **nodemon watch task** for the all files conected to `.api/api.js`
- sets the **environment variable** `NODE_ENV` to `development`
- opens the db connection for `development`
- starts the server on 127.0.0.1:4095

### npm test

This command:

- runs `npm run lint` ([eslint](http://eslint.org/)) with the [airbnb styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) without arrow-parens rule for **better readability**
- sets the **environment variable** `NODE_ENV` to `testing`
- creates the `database.sqlite` for the test
- runs `jest --coverage` for testing with [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and the coverage
- drops the `database.sqlite` after the test

## npm run production

This command:

- sets the **environment variable** to `production`
- opens the db connection for `production`
- starts the server on 127.0.0.1:4095 or on 127.0.0.1:PORT_ENV

Before running on production you have to set the **environment vaiables**:

- DB_NAME - database name for production
- DB_USER - database username for production
- DB_PASS - database password for production
- DB_HOST - database host for production
- JWT_SECERT - secret for json web token

Optional:

- PORT - the port your api on 127.0.0.1, default to 4095

### other commands

- `npm run dev` - simply start the server withou a watcher
- `npm run create-sqlite-db` - creates the sqlite database
- `npm run drop-sqlite-db` - drops **ONLY** the sqlite database
- `npm run lint` - linting with [eslint](http://eslint.org/)
- `npm run nodemon` - same as `npm start``
- `npm run prepush` - a hook wich runs before pushing to a repository, runs `npm test` and `npm run dropDB`
- `pretest` - runs linting before `npm test`
- `test-ci` - only runs tests, nothing in pretest, nothing in posttest, for better use with ci tools
